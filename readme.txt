To address our research question, we aim to understand how we can capture semantic relationships in business ecosystems more effectively than traditional approaches allow. Conventional methods often miss implicit connections between the ecosystem stakeholders, resulting in analytical blind spots for strategic analysts. We introduce The Business Ecosystem Analysis & Representation (BEAR) framework to bridge this knowledge gap by formally integrating theoretical concepts with empirical evidence. Through a collaboration with a successful incumbent manufacturer in the wind energy ecosystem, we identified specific conceptual questions about organizational positioning and supply chain dynamics that existing frameworks struggle to give deep, meaningful answers. Our research approach systematically collected and analyzed data from 35 companies at WindEnergy Hamburg 2024, focusing on uncovering hidden relationships between the ecosystem stakeholders. By learning how these semantic relationships manifest in real business contexts, we contribute to the theoretical understanding of business ecosystem structures and practical tools for strategic analysts facing complex interdependencies.
